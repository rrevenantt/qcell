/// `LCellOwner` uses a closure to contain the invariant lifetime.
/// However it's also worth noting the alternative approach used in
/// crate [`generativity`](https://crates.io/crates/generativity) that
/// uses a macro instead.
///
/// Some history: `GhostCell` by
/// [**pythonesque**](https://github.com/pythonesque) predates the
/// creation of `LCell`, and inspired it.  Discussion of `GhostCell`
/// on Reddit showed that a lifetime-based approach to cells was
/// feasible, but unfortunately the `ghost_cell.rs` source didn't seem
/// to be available under a community-friendly licence.  So I went
/// back to first principles and created `LCell` from `TCell` code,
/// combined with invariant lifetime code derived from the various
/// community sources that predate `GhostCell`.  Later `Send` and
/// `Sync` support for `LCell` was contributed independently.

// instead of just T: Sync is that LCell provides interior mutability.

// can call .rw() to get a &mut T, and use std::mem::swap() to move
// the T, effectively sending the T to that other thread. That's not
// allowed if T: !Send.
//
// Note that the bounds on T for LCell<T>'s impl of Sync are the same
// as those of std::sync::RwLock<T>. That's not a coincidence.
// The way these types let you access T concurrently is the same,
// even though the locking mechanisms are different.
